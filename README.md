The **Sennmetals** are the sister-family to the Neuvolics, serving as the role of the "anti-Neumetals." They only transmute through fixation, and behave with opposite chirality when compared to the Neumetals. Using fixation with two zephiron will switch between the two families for all pairs except Hestium and Typhor, which transmute to themselves. There are no anti-Volics as this would have the same effect as the current Volics but swapped, hence the implementation here.

The Sennmetals also tie into the Orimetals similar to the Neumetals, and this behaviour is documented in the Orimetals' page [here](https://github.com/Hi30MC/origami-ce/blob/main/README.md).

# Atom List

We describe the Sennmetals by their Neumetallic opposite:

| Neumetal | Sennmetal | Abbr. | Verbal Abbrev. | Based on  |            Properties            |
|:--------:|:---------:|:-----:|:--------------:|:---------:|:--------------------------------:|
|  Hestium |   Typhor  |  Typ. |      Typh      |   Typhon  |     Unstable, non-conductive     |
|  Iridium |   Sordi   |  Sor. |    Sor/Sord    |   Sordi   |     dull, slightly poisonous     |
|  Mitrum  |   Eitros  |  Eit. |    Eit/'tros   |    Eitr   |   weak, globular, strong poison  |
|  Azulum  |   Rofor   |  Rof. |      Rof.      |  Xeroform | Yellow, flexible, slight healing |
|  Taceum  |   Serket  |  Ser. |     Ser/Ket    |   Serket  |           Healing, gas           |

# Glyph Behaviour

Fixation: Swaps between Senneumetallic pairs when double Zephiron is inserted. This does not work, however with Hestium and Typhor, which get sent back to themselves. Furthermore, Frixon sends anti-clockwise (Eitros -> Serket -> Rofor...) while Gelaron sends clockwise (Serket -> Eitros -> Sordi...)

Translation (from Origami): Translates between Sennmetals and Orimetals. Table can be found [here](https://github.com/Hi30MC/origami-ce/blob/main/README.md).
